	<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winx_Club" style="font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9; text-decoration: none;">Winx Club</a>, Bloom is the Fairy of the Dragon Flame. She is Prince Sky's fianc√©e, the second princess of Domino and its Guardian Fairy. She is one of the founding members of the Winx Club, where she is recognized as the leader of their group, which also signifies her status as the central protagonist of the Winx Club series as a whole. She is also an alumna/student of the Alfea College for Fairies as of The Secret of the Lost Kingdom. <br><br> In season 2, when she is in her dark form, she is very negative. She does very bad deeds and obeys Lord Darkar loyally. In this form, Bloom is the absolute opposite of herself: she becomes heartless, abusive, unwilling, mean, selfish, manipulative, mischievous, cruel and uncaring. To name an example of her obedience to Darkar, she steals the Codex fragment from Alfea for Darkar. She made other appearances in the last three episodes of Season 2 when Darkar discovered that he needed the powers of light and darkness to claim the Ultimate Power of Relix. <br> <br>

Thanks to Sky confessing his deep love for her, Bloom manages to use her healing power on everyone affected by Darkar's magic, including herself, thus freeing herself from Darkar's control and returning to normal. She returns the Ultimate Power to Relix and joins her friends in a Charmix Convergence that destroys Lord Darkar and his fortress.

  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <h5 class="article-sub-heading">Description</h5>
    <p> Bridgette was a camper in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Drama_Island" style="font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9; text-decoration: none;">Total Drama Island</a> as a member of the Killer Bass. She later returned as a castmate in Total Drama Action but was not placed on a team due to her early elimination. She also qualified for Total Drama World Tour as a member of Team Victory. She is a co-host of the Total Drama Aftermath. She was seen with the original contestants on a yacht in the first episode in Total Drama: Revenge of the Island and had a cameo appearance in Backstabbers Ahoy!. 
      <br><br>
      Bridgette is a calm, compassionate surfer girl who loves animals as much as she loves the water. She is a vegetarian, finding animals to be her friends, not food. In contrast to her aquatic aptitude, Bridgette is known for being clumsy on land, which often leads to severe results. Many aspects of Bridgette's character are revealed in Brunch of Disgustingness, when she refuses to give up her principles, no matter what. When she joins the remaining Screaming Gophers females, she faces one of her biggest challenges in getting them to work as a team. She believes in "building bridges, not walls", even when the competition is not a factor. Through Bridgette's spirit and determination, she always reaches her goal, whether it is getting her team to unite or anything else she sets her mind to.
    <br><br>
    Bridgette commonly shows disapproval for unnecessary violence and conflict, as seen when she was reluctant to shoot paintballs in Paintball Deer Hunter and disapproved of DJ, Duncan, and Geoff pranking Harold. According to Bridgette herself, she cannot stay mad at someone for very long, at most holding a "six-minute" grudge. In the Aftermath, she is shown to value her friendships with the other contestants as ego-driven Geoff tortures the eliminated cast members becoming somewhat of a "Chris Clone". Most notably, even when she is angry with Gwen for her actions, she still warns her about an anvil that will fall on her if she lies.

      <p> Courtney was a camper on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Drama_Island" style="font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9; text-decoration: none;">Total Drama Island </a> a member of the Killer Bass. Although she originally didn't qualify for Total Drama Action, she debuted as a castmate on the season in Ocean's Eight ‚Äî or Nine due to a successful lawsuit. She was placed on the Killer Grips and was the main antagonist for the second half of the season. She competed in Total Drama World Tour as a member of Team Amazon. She was seen with the original contestants on a yacht in the first episode of Total Drama: Revenge of the Island, and later returned as a camper for Total Drama All-Stars where she was placed on the Heroic Hamsters before being moved to the Villainous Vultures.
        <br><br>
        Courtney has a polarizing personality, but at her core, she thinks of herself as a born leader, which often leads to her not letting others have a chance to take control. Although she is extremely bossy, competitive, critical and even manipulative at times, she can be civil and polite to her fellow competitors under specific circumstances and in the beginning of the series. Such examples are in Phobia Factor where Courtney scolds her team for mocking Tyler's fear, Basic Straining, where she stands up for Harold against Duncan and Geoff or in Jamaica Me Sweat, when she is the only one to acknowledge the injured Izzy and Owen. As an overachiever, she has a tendency to overreact when things go wrong, and drives herself crazy in order to get what she wants. She has become notorious among the contestants for constantly reminding them of her counselor-in-training experience, resulting in their constant annoyance.
      <br><br>
      However, throughout her four competing seasons, the severity of Courtney's behavior becomes extremely antagonistic. When she wants something, she will fight to the death to get it, with no regard for the safety of others, going as far to leave people in danger, hence losing her former friendly and civil nature. However, sometimes her determination ultimately leads to her own destruction. Courtney has exceptional athletic abilities and is also capable of lifting amounts of weight much greater than her own. She has displayed in several instances that she values the prize money over even her closest relationships and even capable of risking people‚Äôs lives to get on her goal. Her unscrupulous priorities coupled with her harsh tendencies have resulted in her becoming a very disliked contestant among her fellow competitors as well as someone that is not truly friendly with anyone.

    <h5 class="article-sub-heading">Description</h5>
    <p> In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winx_Club" style="font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9; text-decoration: none;">Winx Club</a>, Darcy is a member of the Trix, a trio of witches, of which she is the most intelligent. Devious and manipulative, Darcy uses darkness, illusions, and hypnotics to confuse and control her opponents. She is a former student of Cloud Tower as she and her close friends, Icy and Stormy, were expelled in "Cold Spell."
      <br><br>
      Much like Icy and Stormy, Darcy demonstrates a sadistic personality but one that is more controlled as she is the least (openly) aggressive of the three. She seems calmer and more competent compared to her sisters and is also good at discovering others' weaknesses to exploit them later. While appearing to have more self-restraint when compared to her sisters, Darcy is still very violent and openly condescending towards others, as she is seen laughing after turning Mirta into a pumpkin, and happily pummels Bloom before taking her powers. Believing that she holds a mastery over all things illusory and hypnotic, Darcy will lash out even more so if anyone else tries to trick her with illusions, as she does in the previously mentioned case with Mirta, whom she turns into a pumpkin simply for trying to defy them with an illusion of her own.
    <br><br>
    Darcy also shares her sisters' lust for power but she is the least likely to let it dominate her life, as she often makes remarks about the appearance and appeal of boys around her age much like any other teen would do. The most obvious case of this was with Riven back in Season 1 as she seemed genuinely attracted to him even while manipulating him after getting him to desert his friends in "A Friendship Sundered." Currently, the only moment of compassion Darcy shows for those other than her sisters is when she expressed concern for Riven's safety and saved him during the Race of the Rose. Even when she did not need to, Darcy made it a habit of taking Riven out on dates once they had become official, however, even her own affections do not make her any less ruthless compared to her sisters. In fact, they make her even more so as, once she gets over her affections for Riven, she tosses him aside like a tool that outlived its usefulness, even after Riven became convinced that she truly cared for him. Her interests in men tend to lie with genuine bad boys like how Riven was initially and how Valtor was for most of Season 3. Although, during her and her sisters' conquest of Magix in the first season, it is made apparent that Darcy could also be a simple flirt, as she expressed a desire to become the new Headmistress of Red Fountain when thinking of their success. Also, as the middle child of the trio, she is usually seen to be more close with Stormy rather than Icy, and can often end up as the butt of both of their jokes.
    <br><br>
    Though Darcy can be regarded as the quietest Trix witch, she is still very vocal towards obvious disrespect. While she greatly disliked Tritannus ever since they first met in the beginning of Season 5, this disdain for the triton prince only grew as he continued to ignore her and Stormy in favor of Icy. Eventually, she was the one to convince Stormy to leave him and even tried to convince Icy to do the same, showing that, in the end, the people she trusts most are her sisters. Even after Icy chose Tritannus over her own sisters, Darcy still went on to execute her plan with Stormy in the hopes of opening Icy's eyes once they ended up successful without Tritannus.
